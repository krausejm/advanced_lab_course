# Advanced Lab Course
This is the advanced lab course at Bonn university. Collaborators are [Jakob](https://github.com/krausejm) and [Dominic](https://github.com/dschuechter).
We performed the following experiments

1. [E214 - ATLAS](https://github.com/krausejm/advanced_lab_course/tree/main/ATLAS) (grade: 1.0)
2. [E207 - Linear Accelerator Bonn (LAB)](https://github.com/krausejm/advanced_lab_course/tree/main/LAB) (grade: 1.0)
3. [K223 - Nuclear gamma-gamma-Correlations](https://github.com/krausejm/advanced_lab_course/tree/main/K223) (grade: 1.0)
4. [A246 - Laser spectroscopy](https://github.com/krausejm/advanced_lab_course/tree/main/A246) (grade: 2.3)
5. [K221 - Mößbauer-effect](https://github.com/krausejm/advanced_lab_course/tree/main/K221) (grade: 1.3)


there will be one folder for each experiment, containing the lab report and our data aside ``python/root``-scripts used for data analysis. We also scanned our notes we used to prepare for the oral examination at the beginning of each experiment, these are listed as ``*_notes.pdf``. All our oral exams were graded 1.0.


Note also that in the subfolders ``figs`` there are figures which are not created by us. The appropiate source for every figure is given in the respective lab reports.
